\title{Sample Size Calculation for the two-sided t-Test}
\usage{
n_ttest(alpha, power, r, r.strict = TRUE, effect, sd)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Significance level \eqn{\alpha}.}

\item{power}{Desired Power \eqn{1-\beta}.}

\item{r}{Quotient of Sample sizes \eqn{r = n_Y / n_X}.}

\item{r.strict}{Allocation Handling. Default = TRUE. If set to TRUE,
the Sample size  per Group is round up to the next combination hitting the
specified allocation exactly. If set to FALSE, the Sample size per
Group is round up to the next natural number.}

\item{effect}{Effect \eqn{\Delta_A} used as alternative hypothesis.}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation \eqn{\sigma}.}
}
\value{
\code{n_ttest} returns an object of type list. The resulting
  Sample Sizes are located in entrys named \code{n_X}, \code{n_Y}, \code{n}.
  The resulting power is named \code{power_out}.
}
\description{
\code{n_ttest} performs the Sample Size calculation for the t-Test
  to the level \eqn{\alpha} comparing two independent samples.
  The method is based on the pages 16 - 18 in [1].

  \item{Null Hypothesis:}{\eqn{\mu_Y - \mu_X = 0}}
  \item{Alternative Hypothesis:}{\eqn{\abs{\mu_Y - \mu_X} \ge \Delta_A}}
